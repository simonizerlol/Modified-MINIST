# Modified-MINIST
machine learning kaggle competition

We added the modified our code so that it downloads the data files from a hosted space,
http://cs.mcgill.ca/~ksinha4/datasets/kaggle/, and we have tested it and it ran accordingly.

We have put our code all in jupyter notebook files and ran them to save you the time from running it.

The original set-up was to put the 3 given data sets(train_x.csv, train_y.csv, and test_x.csv)
in the input folder we created, and you can execute any notebook/.py files without a problem doing so.

All our code are in the module folder.
All our predictions are in csv inside the output folder.

### Development Status:
* A baseline linear learner of SVM using sklearn library: Done
* a fully connected feed forward neural network trained by backpropagation, where the architecture of the network (number of nodes, layers, learning rate, etc.) are determined by cross-validation: Done
* CNN using pytorch library: Done
