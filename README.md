We have put our code all in jupyter notebook files and ran them to save you the time from running it.

The original set-up was to put the 3 given data sets(train_x.csv, train_y.csv, and test_x.csv)
in the input folder we created, and you can execute any notebook/.py files without a problem doing so.

All our code are in the module folder.
All our predictions are in csv inside the output folder.

### Development Status:
* A baseline linear learner of SVM implemented using sklearn library: Done
* A fully connected feed forward neural network trained by backpropagation, where the architecture of the network (number of nodes, layers, learning rate, etc.) are determined by cross-validation: Done
* CNN implemented using pytorch library: Done
